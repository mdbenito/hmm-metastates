# metastates

Runs a Hidden Markov Model on a sequence of states coming from HMMAR.
Multiple runs can be run in parallel to compute using different numbers of meta-states.

Cross-validation can be performed on the results...

## Dependencies

* [hmmlearn](https://github.com/hmmlearn): hmmlearn is a set of algorithms
 for unsupervised learning and inference of Hidden Markov Models.
  Install in [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/) using
    `conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/bcbio hmmlearn`

## Usage

`python metastates.py ...`
